Hello
If you have any issues or comments on the project, contact me on Linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/engabduallah).
I also provided all the files that I used in this project so that you can try them yourself. 

Insight about the project: 

Implement smart cooling controller system on AVR AT Mega128 (UNI-DS6 development board), using Atmel Studio to compile the code and Proteus 8 to simulate the system. The system aims to keep the environment cool. 
To achieve that, it simultaneously keeps track of the temperature using a potentiometer sensor. Then, the system takes action accordingly by activating a PC fan using the L293D driver and simultaneously displaying the fan speed and temperature on a 4-bit LCD screen.

Enjoy it. 

All rights are saved, if you want to use any piece of the code, mentioning my name will be enough.
